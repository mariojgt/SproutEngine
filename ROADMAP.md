- **Rendering**: wgpu (cross-platform graphics)
- **Physics**: Rapier (Rust physics engine)
- **Audio**: Bevy Audio + advanced audio processing
- **UI**: egui for editor, custom UI system for games
- **Scripting**: Rust (native) + Visual scripting system
- **Asset Pipeline**: Custom asset processing with Bevy Assets

### Performance Goals
- 60+ FPS for complex scenes
- Sub-10ms frame times for VR readiness
- Efficient memory usage
- Scalable rendering pipeline
- Fast iteration times (hot reloading)

### Compatibility Goals
- Support for major 3D software exports (Blender, Maya, 3ds Max)
- Standard formats (glTF, FBX, USD)
- Cross-platform development
- Industry-standard workflows

## Success Metrics
- Feature parity with Game Engine 4 core features
- Active community of 1000+ developers
- 10+ published games using the engine
- Documentation covering 90% of features
- Sub-30 second build times for medium projects

## Getting Started - Next Steps
1. Set up the enhanced UI system
2. Implement advanced gizmos and viewport controls
3. Create a robust asset pipeline
4. Build the material editor foundation
5. Establish the visual scripting framework

This roadmap is ambitious but achievable with dedication and community support. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation while adding increasingly sophisticated features.
