- **Documentation**: Tutorials, API docs, guides, examples
- **Testing**: Bug reports, platform testing, performance testing
- **Design**: UI/UX improvements, icon design, themes
- **Community**: Discord moderation, forum support, social media

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup
1. Install Rust (latest stable): https://rustup.rs/
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mariojgt/SproutEngine.git`
3. Install dependencies: `cargo check`
4. Run the engine: `cargo run`
5. Run tests: `cargo test`

### Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Ensure all tests pass: `cargo test`
6. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add amazing feature"`
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
8. Open a Pull Request

## üìù Code Guidelines

### Rust Style
- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Write documentation for public APIs
- Add examples in doc comments when helpful

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a capital letter
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

Example:
```
Add material editor with PBR workflow

- Implement material property editing
- Add texture slot management
- Support for albedo, normal, metallic maps
- Include material preview system
```

### Code Organization
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables
- Add comments for complex logic
- Separate editor code from engine core
- Follow the existing architecture patterns

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Test on multiple platforms when possible
- Include performance tests for critical paths

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run doctests
cargo test --doc
```
